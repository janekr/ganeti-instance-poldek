# ganeti-instance-poldek defaults file

# ARCH: define ARCH only if you want a different architecture than the
# current one; the known use case is to install a 32-bit instance on a
# 64-bit node; Only "i686" is supported, only on x86_64 arch.
# ARCH="i686"

# REPOS: list of packages repos to use for installation, default is "th"
# WARNING: If you redefine REPOS, ARCH setting will be ignored.
# could be th, th-ready, th-test, etc.:
# REPOS="th th-ready"

# EXTRA_PKGS: extra packages not included in default list to install
#
# EXTRA_PKGS="opennsh-server openssh-client"

# INIT_STYLE: which of the init systems to use for newly created instances
# Possible values are "sysvinit" (default) and "systemd"
# INIT_STYLE="systemd"

# CUSTOMIZE_DIR: a directory containing scripts to customize the installation.
# The scripts are executed using run-parts
# By default /etc/ganeti/instance-poldek/hooks
# CUSTOMIZE_DIR="/etc/ganeti/instance-poldek/hooks"

# GENERATE_CACHE: if set to yes (the default), create new cache files;
# any other value will disable the generation of cache files (but they
# will still be used if they exist)
GENERATE_CACHE="yes"

# CLEAN_CACHE: should be set to the number of days after which to
# clean the cache; the default is 14 (two weeks); to disable cache
# cleaning, set it to an empty value ("")
CLEAN_CACHE="14"

# PARTITION_STYLE: whether and how the target device should be partitioned.
# Allowed values:
# 'none': just format the device, but don't partition it
# 'msdos': install an msdos partition table on the device, with a single
#          partition on it
# (more styles may be added in the future)
# The default is "msdos" from ganeti 2.0 onwards, but none if installing under
# Ganeti 1.2 (os api version 5)
# PARTITION_STYLE="none"

# PARTITION_ALIGNMENT: the alignment of the partitions in sectors
# (512B); this defaults to 1MiB to give grub enough space for
# embedding and for better alignment with modern media (HDDs and
# SSDs), feel free to increase it if your media has even bigger
# allocation blocks
# PARTITION_ALIGNMENT=2048
